        The creative biography of Pablo Picasso is truly extreme. Marc Chagall
        once said that Picasso changes style more often than socks. In each
        subsequent period, it is so different that it seems as if it was written
        by different people.

        Picasso himself joked about this. And although he went down in the
        history of world art as the creator of cubism, cubism as such was only
        one of the periods of his work and took only one decade. And he worked
        for over 70 years! And this is not counting the decades of the early
        period of his apprenticeship at home, in Spain, when he was just looking
        for himself.
