      "The creative biography of Pablo Picasso is truly extreme. Marc Chagall once said that Picasso changes style more often than socks. In each subsequent period, it is so different that it seems as if it was written by different people. <q>Everyone has the right to change, even artists,</q> Picasso himself joked about this. And although he went down in the history of world art as the creator of cubism, cubism as such was only one of the periods of his work and took only one decade. And he worked for over 70 years! And this is not counting the decades of the early period of his apprenticeship at home, in Spain, when he was just looking for himself.",

      "Unlike those who remained \"outside the frame\", <strong>these seven women</strong> were fortunate enough to take part not only in Picasso's personal life. Fascinated by the servants of the rite of art, they ascended to the sacrificial podium, completely surrendering to their high priest, Each of them, embodied on canvases, marks a certain period or periods of the artist's career.",
